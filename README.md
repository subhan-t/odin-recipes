# odin-recipes

My first README file for odin-recipes.
At this stage I have built the html only version of odin-recipes. I learned to create a basic html file for index.html and link other html pages to it. I did this with just one commit. Looking back it's probably a good idea to do some intermediate commits as well. Since this was a very simple project so far, I didn't feel the need for more commits but that's not a habit I want to get into. Committing at every meaningful change should be a habit.
